## Always check the small print.  

The difference between making or breaking and  getting getting ripped.

It's always in the small or light gray print.  


__The AI Bot wrote__ 

The small print, oh how it hides,
In a font that's small and sly it resides,
A footnote, a clause, a tiny line,
That can make all the difference in what we sign.

In the sea of words, it may be lost,
But its importance is never to be tossed,
For it holds the truth of what we'll get,
And what we'll lose, what we'll regret.

Beneath the surface, it may be found,
In a language that's hard to comprehend, bound,
But it's worth the effort to read and know,
Before we make a deal, before we go.

For in the small print lies the deal,
The difference between fair and unreal,
The devil is in the details they say,
So always check before you pay.
