### Business Sentiments reports.   

Discover interesting insights about your business from public reviews.
There may be reviews that are affecting your business and potential customers. However, without a dedicated Social Media communications manager, it may be long before you address a poor review. 

These reviews can affect your business as thousands of people may respond to that negative sentiment. Our bot will scan the most popular reviews and comments for details about your business's services or products and analyze these using a machine-learning analyzer to produce a sentiment score.
Your report will allow you to deal with negative or positive sentiments and help improve your business's image.
Our sentiments can help you identify problem areas and fix these quickly.

### Home Energy Monitoring Systems.

The Energy Monitor Bot is an artificially intelligent bot that will help you reduce your energy bills by as much as 40% a year. It monitors the energy consumption of all your devices in your house, so you know what's consuming the most power.

Have you ever wondered how much your energy use affects your monthly energy bill? With the help of an AI-powered home energy monitoring bot, you'll be able to identify huge savings from your energy bills.

With rising living costs, it can be difficult to identify where energy savings can be made. 
Home energy costs are some of the most expensive outgoings for most households.
With tariffs that do not readily reflect usage,  and confusing terms and conditions, it's confusing for the consumer to try to get as good a deal as possible. 

The energy company guess your costs based purely on your historical usage.
If you can reduce this consumption figure in peak periods, you can use this data when renegotiating deals.

The energy bot will monitor your daily usage and break this down into categories. 

The energy monitoring bot can produce reports to identify savings that will bring down your average consumption, which your supplier can use to negotiate your payments.

The energy bot uses machine-learning data to find hidden consumption that can save you hundreds in energy costs.
